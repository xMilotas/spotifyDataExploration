# Exploring the depths of my listening habits

Music has been a huge part of my life and I have been using Spotify for my listing pleasures ever since 2013. 

About a year ago I stumbled upon an article that noted that Spotify now gives you the opportunity to request and download the data they store about you. (At least one positive thing that came out of GDPR, huh)

Eager to find out, I filled out the request form and waited a couple of days.  
Eventually I got the notice that my data could now be downloaded. 

"Oh boy, finally, this is gonna be fun!" I thought to myself, only to be let down quickly again, because the earliest data point I was able to find is actually from October 2018. 

Ever since I've been regularly requesting my stored data and running different analysis on it. 

This repository is a collection of my first steps towards data exploration while learning new visualization techniques. 


# Data

The data itself follows a simple schema, we have minimal information containing the song name, the artist, the album, the number of milliseconds a song was played and a time stamp of when the song has finished playing.
